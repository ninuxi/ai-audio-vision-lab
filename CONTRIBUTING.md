# Contributing to AI Audio Vision Lab

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AI Audio Vision Lab! üéõÔ∏èüéµ

This project represents significant research and development in AI-powered creative applications. While the core algorithms are proprietary, we welcome contributions to the demo version, documentation, and related tools.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

#### üêõ Bug Reports and Issues
- Demo functionality issues
- Installation problems on different platforms
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimization suggestions

#### üìö Documentation
- Tutorial improvements
- Code examples and samples
- Translation of documentation
- Architecture explanation enhancements

#### üîß Demo and Tools
- Additional demo scripts
- Visualization tools
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Platform compatibility improvements

#### üé® Creative Contributions
- Sample audio files for demonstrations
- Test images for object detection
- Creative use cases and applications
- Educational materials

### ‚ùå Contributions NOT Accepted

Due to the proprietary nature of core algorithms:
- Core semantic mapping implementations
- Trained model weights or architectures
- Production optimization code
- Commercial deployment configurations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git knowledge
- Familiarity with PyTorch/TensorFlow (for technical contributions)
- Understanding of audio processing (for audio-related contributions)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-audio-vision-lab.git
   cd ai-audio-vision-lab
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv dev_env
   source dev_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dev_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function signatures
- **Comments**: Clear, concise comments explaining complex logic

#### Example Code Style:
```python
def process_audio_sample(audio_data: np.ndarray, 
                        sample_rate: int = 44100) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process audio sample for demo purposes.
    
    Args:
        audio_data: Raw audio samples as numpy array
        sample_rate: Sample rate in Hz
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed audio metadata
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If audio_data is empty or invalid
    """
    if len(audio_data) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Audio data cannot be empty")
    
    # Process audio here
    result = {"duration": len(audio_data) / sample_rate}
    return result
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples:
git commit -m "Add audio visualization demo script"
git commit -m "Fix installation issue on macOS"
git commit -m "Update documentation for Raspberry Pi setup"
git commit -m "Improve error handling in demo interface"

# Avoid:
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "changes"
```
